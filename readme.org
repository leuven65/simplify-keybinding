* About
This library is to simplify the Emacs keybinding for the commands which have same prefix leading
key, so that we don't need to press the prefix leading key.

Such as, By defining simplied keybindings for ~winner-undo~ ("C-c <left>") and ~winner-redo~ ("C-c
<right>"), if last command is one of them, it doesn't need to press "C-c" again to next command.

It is possible to use ~Hydra~ to implement similar functions, but I think the way used here is more simple and clear.

* Installation
Clone this git repo to "${user-emacs-directory}/packages/simplify-keybinding", and add folowing
lines to Emacs config file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package simplify-keybinding
    :defer t
    :ensure nil ; it is github package
    ;; If the path is relative, it is expanded within `user-emacs-directory'
    :load-path "packages/simplify-keybinding"
    :init
    (load "hide-region-autoloads.el")
    )
#+end_src

* Usage
Just use ~SK-define-keymap~ to define the simplified keybindings, please see the examples below.

~SK-setup-default-keymap~ can setup these example keybindings automatically.

** For winner
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (SK-define-keymap
   (("<left>" winner-undo "← undo")
    ("<right>" winner-redo "→ redo"))
   "Winner: ")
#+end_src

** For "prev-buffer" and "next-buffer"
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (SK-define-keymap
   (("<left>" previous-buffer "← prev-buffer")
    ("<right>" next-buffer "→ next-buffer"))
   "Buffer: ")
#+end_src

** For navigating on compile errors
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'compile
    (SK-define-keymap
     (("M-n" next-error "M-n next-error")
      ("M-p" previous-error "M-p prev-error"))
     "Compilation error: ")
    )
#+end_src

** For navigating on org-mode headlines
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (SK-define-keymap
   (("C-n" org-next-visible-heading "C-n next")
    ("C-p" org-previous-visible-heading "C-p pre")
    ("C-u" outline-up-heading "C-u up")
    ("C-f" org-forward-heading-same-level "C-f foward")
    ("C-b" org-backward-heading-same-level "C-b backward")
    )
   "Navigate headlines: "
   (derived-mode-p 'org-mode))
#+end_src
